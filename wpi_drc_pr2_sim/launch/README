List of launch files and what they launch

1) pr2_driving_wheel_on_table:
  
   Launches logitech driving force racing wheel on a table modeled after the table we have at ARC lab. 

2) pr2_driving_wheel_on_table_headless:

   Starts the same setup as (1) but doesn't run Gazebo GUI. If you don't need to see the simulator (for instance if you're already running RViz) then this could saves you energy and CPU power.

3) Any launch file that starts with a time stamp is auto generated by one of the scripts you can find under wpi_drc_sim/scripts directory.
