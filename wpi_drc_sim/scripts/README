SCRIPTS

    1) launch_generator_v1.py

    2) launch_generator_v2.py

       Will generate a:
	i) <current_time_stamp>.launch file in wpi_drc/launch directory, and,
       ii) <current_time_stamp>-<valve_number>.urdf file in wpi_drc/descriptions directory. Number of urdf files to be generated is defined in the scripts with the variable numModels. 

    3) launch_generator_v3.py

       Same as the previous script but it generates launch files to run Gazebo headless.

    You can run any of the scripts with:

      $ rosrun wpi_drc_sim <script_name>

    or

      $ roscd wpi_drc_sim/scripts/
      $ python <script_name>.py
